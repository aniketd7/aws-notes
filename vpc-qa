How Do You Connect My Vpc To The Internet?
Answer :
Amazon VPC supports the creation of an Internet gateway. This gateway enables Amazon EC2 instances in the VPC to directly access the Internet.

What Are The Components Of Amazon Vpc?
Answer:
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): 
		A logically isolated virtual network in the AWS cloud. You define a VPC’s IP address space from a range you select.
Subnet: 
		A segment of a VPC’s IP address range where you can place groups of isolated resources.
Internet Gateway: 
		The Amazon VPC side of a connection to the public Internet.
NAT Gateway:
		 A highly available, managed Network Address Translation (NAT) service for your resources in a private subnet to access the Internet.
Hardware VPN Connection:
		 A hardware-based VPN connection between your Amazon VPC and your datacenter, home network, or co-location facility.
Virtual Private Gateway: 
		The Amazon VPC side of a VPN connection.
Customer Gateway: 
		Your side of a VPN connection.
Router: 
		Routers interconnect subnets and direct traffic between Internet gateways, virtual private gateways, NAT gateways, and subnets.
•Peering Connection: 
		A peering connection enables you to route traffic via private IP addresses between two peered VPCs.
VPC Endpoint for S3: 
		Enables Amazon S3 access from within your VPC without using an Internet gateway or NAT, and allows you to control the access using VPC endpoint p
LI>Egress-only Internet Gateway: 
		A stateful gateway to provide egress only access for IPv6 traffic from the VPC to the Internet

 Why Should You Use Amazon Vpc, Advantage Of Using Aws Vpc?
Answer: 
Amazon VPC enables you to build a virtual network in the AWS cloud - no VPNs, hardware, or physical datacenters required. 
You can define your own network space and control how your network, and the Amazon EC2 resources inside your network, is exposed to the Internet.

What Is The Difference Between Stateful And Stateless Filtering?
Answer: 
Stateful: 
remember the state of the data stream passed through (what happened in all previous packets) 
and filter based on the same list as in case of stateless, but filter also based on state information.
For example, a stateful filter that allows inbound traffic to TCP port 80 on a webserver will allow the return traffic, 
usually on a high numbered port (e.g., destination TCP port 63, 912) to pass through the stateful filter between the client and the webserver. 

Stateless: 
don't remember any state, just filter the current packet passing through according to the rule list.
 In the above example, two rules would need to be implemented on the filtering device: one rule to allow traffic 
inbound to the web server on TCP port 80, and another rule to allow outbound traffic from the webserver (TCP port range 49, 152 through 65, 535).

Can Amazon Ec2 Instances Within A Vpc Communicate With Amazon Ec2 Instances Not Within A Vpc?

How Do You Secure Amazon Ec2 Instances Running Within My Vpc?
Answer:
Amazon EC2 security groups can be used to help secure instances within an Amazon VPC.
In addition to security groups, network traffic entering and exiting each subnet can be allowed or denied via network Access Control Lists (ACLs).

What Are The Differences Between Security Groups In A Vpc And Network Acls In A Vpc?
Answer :
Security groups in a VPC specify which traffic is allowed to or from an Amazon EC2 instance. 
Network ACLs operate at the subnet level and evaluate traffic entering and exiting a subnet. 
Network ACLs can be used to set both Allow and Deny rules. 
Network ACLs do not filter traffic between instances in the same subnet. 
In addition, network ACLs perform stateless filtering while security groups perform stateful filtering.

How Do You Determine Which Availability Zone My Subnets Are Located In?
Answer :
When you create a subnet you must specify the Availability Zone in which to place the subnet. 
When using the VPC Wizard, you can select the subnet's Availability Zone in the wizard confirmation screen.
 If you don’t specify an Availability Zone, the default "No Preference" option will be selected and the subnet 
will be created in an available Availability Zone in the region.

What Is A Default Vpc?
Answer :
A default VPC is a logically isolated virtual network in the AWS cloud that is automatically created 
for your AWS account the first time you provision Amazon EC2 resources. When you launch an instance without 
specifying a subnet-ID, your instance will be launched in your default VPC.

What Are The Advantage Of A Default Vpc?

If You Delete My Side Of A Peering Connection, Will The Other Side Still Have Access To My Vpc?
Answer :
No. Either side of the peering connection can terminate the peering connection at any time. 
Terminating a peering connection means traffic won’t flow between the two VPCs.

If You Peer Vpc A To Vpc B And I Peer Vpc B To Vpc C, Does That Mean Vpcs A And C Are Peered?
Answer :
No. Transitive peering relationships are not supported.

What If Your Peering Connection Goes Down?

The DescribeVPNConnection API displays the status of the VPN connection, including the state ("up"/"down") 
of each VPN tunnel and corresponding error messages if either tunnel is "down". This information is also displayed in the AWS Management Console.

How Do I Connect A Vpc To My Corporate Datacenter?
Answer :
Establishing a hardware VPN connection between your existing network and Amazon VPC allows you to interact with Amazon EC2 instances 
within a VPC as if they were within your existing network. AWS does not perform network address translation (NAT) on Amazon EC2 instances 
within a VPC accessed via a hardware VPN connection.

 Can You Assign Any Ip Address To An Instance?
Answer :
You can assign any IP address to your instance as long as it is:

Part of the associated subnet's IP address range
Not reserved by Amazon for IP networking purposes
Not currently assigned to another interface

 Can You Assign Multiple Ip Addresses To An Instance?
Answer :
Yes. You can assign one or more secondary private IP addresses to an Elastic Network Interface or an EC2 instance in Amazon VPC. 
The number of secondary private IP addresses you can assign depends on the instance type

Can You Change A Vpc's Size?
Answer :
No. To change the size of a VPC you must terminate your existing VPC and create a new one.

 Is There A Limit On How Large Or Small A Subnet Can Be?
Answer :
The minimum size of a subnet is a /28 (or 14 IP addresses.) for IPv4. Subnets cannot be larger than the VPC in which they are created.

 How Do You Assign Private Ip Addresses To Amazon Ec2 Instances Within A Vpc?
Answer :
When you launch an Amazon EC2 instance within a VPC, you may optionally specify the primary private IP address for the instance.
 If you do not specify the primary private IP address, AWS automatically addresses it from the IP address range you assign to that subnet. 
You can assign secondary private IP addresses when you launch an instance, when you create an Elastic Network Interface, 
or any time after the instance has been launched or the interface has been created.
