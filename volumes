Root Device Types is of 2 types

- Elastic Block Storage (EBS) -- This is the default type now.
- Instance Store
	This is also known as Epehemeral (i.e. Temporary) Storage.


Instance Store 

It is used for temp. storage. 
in this you can not stop/start the instance. 
if u reboot or terminate the instance you will lose the data.

What are the chances to lose the data.

-- The underlying disk drive fails 
-- The instance Stops
-- The instance terminates

When to use these type of root device

for buffer , caches , scratch data and other temporary content.

Elastic Block Storage (EBS)

This EBS contains 5 EBS volume types
Normally volume performace is measured by IOPS(Input Output Per Second).
For all the EBS volume category 80,000 IOPS/Instance 

In 5  Root Vol Types 3 are SSD and 2 are HDD

SSD :
1. GP2
2. io1
3. magnetic
Performance is measured in IOPS

HDD:
1. st1
2. Sc1 
Performance is measured in Throughputs 
--------------------------
For Root Volumes : GP2, Io1, Magnetic	we can use these 3 only.
For addition volumes: we can use all the 5 i.e. GP2, io1, magnetic, st1, sc1
--------------------------
1. GP2 	SSD	: General Purpose SSD:  	Min volume size : 1G		Max : 16TB ,	MAX IOPS: 16000
We can use this for : Boot Volume,  Low-Latency intensive apps, Dev & Test env.
for 1G = 3 IOPS	Min 100 / 3000 Burstable

2. io1 SSD		:  Provisoned IOPS : 	Min Volume Size : 4G		Max : 16TB
We can use this for DB servers , Nosql, Prod env
1 GB == 50 IOPS, 	Max IOPS: 64.000 IOPS

3. Magnetic 	: 	Min vol : 1G 	Max Vol : 1TB
We can use for low cost storage 		IOPS not applicable for this.

4. St1		:	Throughput optimized 	HDD min 	: 500G,		Max:	16TB
We can use for BigData operations, Data warehouses, Log process
500 MB/S throughputs

5. Sc1		:	Cold HDD: 		Min  vol size 	:	500GB,		Max: 	16TB
We  can use for less frequent access data.
